# Plan Setup

**Plan**: $ARGUMENTS
**Workflow ID**: $WORKFLOW_ID

---

## ⚠️ LMAO Project Rules (MANDATORY — from AGENTS.md)

- **NEVER run esptool on the Cardputer** (`/dev/ttyACM*`) or flash the RNode via esptool (`/dev/ttyUSB*`). The Cardputer is flashed ONLY via `bazel run //cardputer_client:flash`; the RNode only via https://flasher.rnode.network/.
- **Leave the production Cardputer running** with restored config/DEST_HASH after any test session.
- **Bazel is the canonical build.** Every new `*.py` file must belong to a BUILD target — a test file without a `py_test` target silently never runs (issue #87).
- Lint: `ruff check` / `ruff format --check`; type-check: `mypy` — changed files only. Vendored code (`cardputer_client/lib/urns/**`, `rnode_firmware/esptool.py`) is lint-exempt.
- Unit gate: `bazel test //tests:all --test_tag_filters=-requires_hardware`.

---

## Your Mission

Prepare everything needed for plan implementation:
1. Read and parse the plan (including scope limits)
2. Ensure we're on the correct branch
3. Write a comprehensive context artifact for subsequent steps

**This step does NOT implement anything** - it only sets up the environment.
**This step does NOT create a PR** - that happens in \`archon-finalize-pr\` after implementation.

---

## Phase 1: LOAD - Read the Plan

### 1.1 Locate Plan File

**Check in order:**

1. **If \`$ARGUMENTS\` provided**: Use that path
2. **If plan already in workflow artifacts**: Use \`$ARTIFACTS_DIR/plan.md\`

\`\`\`bash
# Check if plan was created by archon-create-plan in this workflow
if [ -f "$ARTIFACTS_DIR/plan.md" ]; then
  PLAN_PATH="$ARTIFACTS_DIR/plan.md"
  echo "Using plan from workflow: $PLAN_PATH"
elif [ -n "$ARGUMENTS" ] && [ -f "$ARGUMENTS" ]; then
  PLAN_PATH="$ARGUMENTS"
  echo "Using plan from arguments: $PLAN_PATH"
else
  echo "ERROR: No plan found"
  exit 1
fi
\`\`\`

### 1.2 Load Plan File

Read the plan file:

\`\`\`bash
cat $PLAN_PATH
\`\`\`

If \`$ARGUMENTS\` is a GitHub issue URL or number (e.g., \`#123\`), fetch the issue body instead.

### 1.3 Extract Key Information

From the plan, identify and extract:

| Field | Where to Find | Example |
|-------|---------------|---------|
| **Title** | First \`#\` heading or "Summary" section | "Discord Platform Adapter" |
| **Summary** | "Summary" or "Feature Description" section | 1-2 sentence overview |
| **Files to Change** | "Files to Change" or "Tasks" section | List of CREATE/UPDATE files |
| **Validation Commands** | "Validation Commands" or "Validation Strategy" | \`bazel build //...\`, \`bazel test ...\`, etc. |
| **Acceptance Criteria** | "Acceptance Criteria" section | Checklist items |
| **NOT Building (Scope Limits)** | "NOT Building", "Scope Limits", or "Out of Scope" section | Explicit exclusions |

**CRITICAL**: The "NOT Building" section defines what is **intentionally excluded** from scope. This MUST be captured and passed to review agents so they don't flag intentional exclusions as bugs.

### 1.4 Derive Branch Name

Create a branch name from the plan title:

\`\`\`
feature/{slug}
\`\`\`

Where \`{slug}\` is the title lowercased, spaces replaced with hyphens, max 50 chars.

Examples:
- "Discord Platform Adapter" \u2192 \`feature/discord-platform-adapter\`
- "ESLint/Prettier Integration" \u2192 \`feature/eslint-prettier-integration\`

**PHASE_1_CHECKPOINT:**

- [ ] Plan file loaded and readable
- [ ] Key information extracted
- [ ] Branch name derived

---

## Phase 2: PREPARE - Git State

### 2.1 Check Current State

\`\`\`bash
git branch --show-current
git status --porcelain
git remote get-url origin
\`\`\`

### 2.2 Determine Repository Info

Extract owner/repo from the remote URL for PR creation:

\`\`\`bash
gh repo view --json nameWithOwner -q .nameWithOwner
\`\`\`

### 2.3 Branch Decision

Evaluate in order (first matching case wins):

\`\`\`text
\u250C\u2500 IN WORKTREE?
\u2502  \u2514\u2500 YES \u2192 Use current branch AS-IS. Do NOT switch branches. Do NOT create
\u2502           new branches. The isolation system has already set up the correct
\u2502           branch; any deviation operates on the wrong code.
\u2502           Log: "Using worktree branch: {name}"
\u2502
\u251C\u2500 ON $BASE_BRANCH? (main, master, or configured base branch)
\u2502  \u2514\u2500 Q: Working directory clean?
\u2502     \u251C\u2500 YES \u2192 Create and checkout: \`git checkout -b {branch-name}\`
\u2502     \u2502        (only applies outside a worktree \u2014 e.g., manual CLI usage)
\u2502     \u2514\u2500 NO  \u2192 STOP: "Uncommitted changes on $BASE_BRANCH. Stash or commit first."
\u2502
\u2514\u2500 ON OTHER BRANCH?
   \u2514\u2500 Q: Does it match the expected branch for this plan?
      \u251C\u2500 YES \u2192 Use it, log "Using existing branch: {name}"
      \u2514\u2500 NO  \u2192 STOP: "On branch {X}, expected {Y}. Switch branches or adjust plan."
\`\`\`

### 2.4 Sync with Remote

\`\`\`bash
git fetch origin
git rebase origin/$BASE_BRANCH || git merge origin/$BASE_BRANCH
\`\`\`

If conflicts occur, STOP with error: "Merge conflicts with $BASE_BRANCH. Resolve manually."

### 2.5 Push Branch (if commits exist)

If there are commits on the branch:
\`\`\`bash
git push -u origin HEAD
\`\`\`

If no commits yet (fresh branch), skip push - it will happen after implementation.

**PHASE_2_CHECKPOINT:**

- [ ] On correct branch
- [ ] No uncommitted changes
- [ ] Up to date with base branch

---

## Phase 3: ARTIFACT - Write Context File

### 3.1 Create Artifact Directory

\`\`\`bash
\`\`\`

### 3.2 Write Context Artifact

Write to \`$ARTIFACTS_DIR/plan-context.md\`:

\`\`\`markdown
# Plan Context

**Generated**: {YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM}
**Workflow ID**: $WORKFLOW_ID
**Plan Source**: $ARGUMENTS

---

## Branch

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Branch** | {branch-name} |
| **Base** | {base-branch} |

---

## Plan Summary

**Title**: {extracted-title}

**Overview**: {1-2 sentence summary from plan}

---

## Files to Change

{Copy the "Files to Change" table from the plan, or list extracted files}

| File | Action |
|------|--------|
| \`src/example.ts\` | CREATE |
| \`src/other.ts\` | UPDATE |

---

## NOT Building (Scope Limits)

**CRITICAL FOR REVIEWERS**: These items are **intentionally excluded** from scope. Do NOT flag them as bugs or missing features.

{Copy from plan's "NOT Building", "Scope Limits", or "Out of Scope" section}

- {Explicit exclusion 1 with rationale}
- {Explicit exclusion 2 with rationale}

{If no explicit exclusions in plan: "No explicit scope limits defined in plan."}

---

## Validation Commands

{Copy from plan's "Validation Commands" section}

\`\`\`bash
bazel build //...
ruff check <changed-files>
mypy <changed-files>
bazel test //tests:all --test_tag_filters=-requires_hardware --test_output=errors
\`\`\`

---

## Acceptance Criteria

{Copy from plan's "Acceptance Criteria" section}

- [ ] Criterion 1
- [ ] Criterion 2
- [ ] ...

---

## Patterns to Mirror

{Copy key file references from plan's "Patterns to Mirror" section}

| Pattern | Source File | Lines |
|---------|-------------|-------|
| {pattern-name} | \`src/example.ts\` | 10-50 |

---

## Next Steps

1. \`archon-confirm-plan\` - Verify patterns still exist
2. \`archon-implement-tasks\` - Execute the plan
3. \`archon-validate\` - Run full validation
4. \`archon-finalize-pr\` - Create PR and mark ready
\`\`\`

**PHASE_3_CHECKPOINT:**

- [ ] Artifact directory created
- [ ] \`plan-context.md\` written with all sections
- [ ] "NOT Building" section captured (even if empty)

---

## Phase 4: OUTPUT - Report to User

\`\`\`markdown
## Plan Setup Complete

**Plan**: \`$ARGUMENTS\`
**Workflow ID**: \`$WORKFLOW_ID\`

### Branch

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Branch | \`{branch-name}\` |
| Base | \`{base-branch}\` |

### Plan Summary

**{plan-title}**

{1-2 sentence overview}

### Scope

- {N} files to create
- {M} files to update
- {K} explicit exclusions captured

### Artifact

Context written to: \`$ARTIFACTS_DIR/plan-context.md\`

### Next Step

Proceed to \`archon-confirm-plan\` to verify the plan's research is still valid.
\`\`\`

---

## Error Handling

### Plan File Not Found

\`\`\`
\u274C Plan not found: $ARGUMENTS

Verify the path exists and try again.
\`\`\`

### Uncommitted Changes on Base Branch

\`\`\`
\u274C Uncommitted changes on base branch

Options:
1. Stash changes: \`git stash\`
2. Commit changes: \`git add . && git commit -m "WIP"\`
3. Discard changes: \`git checkout .\`

Then retry.
\`\`\`

### Merge Conflicts

\`\`\`
\u274C Merge conflicts with $BASE_BRANCH

Resolve conflicts manually:
1. \`git status\` to see conflicts
2. Edit conflicting files
3. \`git add <resolved-files>\`
4. \`git rebase --continue\`

Then retry.
\`\`\`

## Success Criteria

- **PLAN_LOADED**: Plan file read and parsed
- **SCOPE_LIMITS_CAPTURED**: "NOT Building" section extracted (even if empty)
- **BRANCH_READY**: On correct branch, synced with base branch
- **ARTIFACT_WRITTEN**: \`plan-context.md\` contains all required sections including scope limits
