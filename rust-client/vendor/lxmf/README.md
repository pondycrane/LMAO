LXMF-rs is a Rust implementation of the
[Reticulum](https://reticulum.network/) networking stack and the
[LXMF](https://github.com/markqvist/LXMF) messaging stack. The workspace
provides reusable libraries, a typed SDK, host daemons and command-line tools,
plus embedded and FFI surfaces.

## Measured performance

Release dataset: `v0.10.1` at `25a976945cb335dff3be692981151c8741a5fdeb`; Python Reticulum `ea98db4f53dc` and LXMF `727830cefda8`.

| Matched workload | Rust p50 | Python p50 | Rust/Python |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| LXMF message decode | 225 ns | 7.99 ms | 35459.28x |
| LXMF message encode | 385 ns | 2.10 ms | 5450.73x |
| LXMF large message decode | 370 ns | 7.96 ms | 21536.64x |
| LXMF large message encode | 773 ns | 2.12 ms | 2743.59x |

These are matched-workload comparisons, not a claim of whole-system superiority. See [methodology, complete results, variability, and limitations](docs/performance.md).

## Current status

The current release train is
[`v0.11.0`](https://github.com/FreeTAKTeam/LXMF-rs/releases/tag/v0.11.0),
based on the reviewed RNode repair merged as
`56ea9f06c474426b2245739e9cb5e2c325cdb1e2`. It keeps the v0.10.1 RNS 1.5.2
compatibility baseline while tightening BLE/RNode read ownership, KISS
fragmentation, and firmware queue admission. The v0.10.1 release remains the
previous stable evidence boundary.

The compatibility surface targets Python Reticulum 1.5.2 at
`ea98db4f53dcf0defc0e71a16e60d28b1229c4e6` for the next release candidate;
that canonical pin remains unchanged in v0.11.0.

| Area | Current position |
| --- | --- |
| Reticulum software parity | 1,857 applicable entries complete, 0 partial, 0 unmapped, and 1 provenance-backed not-applicable entry |
| LXMF software parity | All seven tracked software scenarios complete |
| Rust/Python interoperability | Direct, link, channel, paper, propagation, and daemon scenarios exercised against pinned references |
| Independent interoperability | Versioned rns-rs and Reticulum-Go evidence published separately for `v0.10.1`; v0.11.0 evidence is qualified by its tag workflows |
| Hardware and external clients | Physical devices, public networks, and third-party clients remain separate evidence tracks and are not claimed by the software-parity result |

project posture, the [v0.11.0 release notes](docs/release-notes-v0.11.0.md),
[v0.11.0 migration guide](docs/migrations/v0.11.0-rnode.md), and the previous
[v0.10.1 release ledger](docs/status/v0.10.1-release.md), and the
[Reticulum](docs/status/reticulum-parity-matrix.md) and

| Install, build, or run the tools | [Getting started](docs/getting-started.md) |
| Integrate the Rust SDK | [SDK guide](docs/sdk/README.md) and [quickstart](docs/sdk/quickstart.md) |
| Understand the crates and binaries | [Workspace and package guide](docs/project-layout.md) |
| Deploy a daemon | [`lxmd` systemd guide](docs/runbooks/lxmd-systemd.md) or [`reticulumd` operations](docs/runbooks/reticulumd-operational-deployment.md) |

## Quick start

Bootstrap a source checkout and run the local daemon:

```bash
make bootstrap
cargo run -p reticulumd --bin reticulumd
```

In another terminal, inspect the available tools:

```bash
cargo run -p lxmf-cli --bin lxmf -- --help
cargo run -p rns-tools --bin rnstatus-rs -- --help
```

Library consumers can start with the umbrella crates:

```toml
[dependencies]
lxmf = "0.11.0"
reticulum-rs = "0.11.0"
```

See [Getting started](docs/getting-started.md) for release downloads, checksum
verification, component crates, and additional run commands.

## Main packages

| Package group | Purpose | Links |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `lxmf`, `lxmf-sdk`, `lxmf-wire` | LXMF wire types and high-level client APIs | [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/lxmf), [docs.rs](https://docs.rs/lxmf), [SDK guide](docs/sdk/README.md) |
| `reticulum-rs`, `reticulum-rs-core`, `reticulum-rs-transport`, `reticulum-rs-rpc` | Reticulum primitives, transport, interfaces, resources, and RPC | [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/reticulum-rs), [docs.rs](https://docs.rs/reticulum-rs), [API overview](docs/lxmf-rs-api.md) |
| `lxmf-cli`, `reticulumd`, `rns-tools` | LXMF, daemon, diagnostic, and operator binaries | [CLI reference](docs/lxmf-cli.md), [examples](docs/examples.md) |
| Embedded crates | `no_std`, managed runtime, mini-node, and C ABI integration | [Package guide](docs/project-layout.md#embedded-libraries), [FFI guide](crates/libs/rns-embedded-ffi/README.md) |

The complete workspace inventory and dependency-boundary rules live in the
[workspace and package guide](docs/project-layout.md). The root
[`Cargo.toml`](Cargo.toml) remains the source of truth for active members.

## Validation

Use focused checks while developing and broaden them as the change requires:

```bash
cargo fmt --all -- --check
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets --all-features --no-deps -- -D warnings
cargo test --workspace --tests
tools/scripts/check-boundaries.sh
```

Release-facing changes should also pass:

```bash
cargo run -p xtask -- architecture-checks
cargo xtask release-check
```

See the [release-readiness runbook](docs/runbooks/release-readiness.md) for the
full gate and evidence boundaries.
